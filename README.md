# Building Common ML Models From Scratch

This is a cumulation of some of the work I did during my ML studies during 2020

The goal was to build commonly used ML methods by designing and building each of the models from scratch, improving python skills, while acquiring a deep understand of the algorithms, the math behind them and the results they provide, in the process.
Naturally, these are not meant to replace scikit-learn packages and models in everyday use.
