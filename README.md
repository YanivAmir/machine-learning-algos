# Building Common ML Models From Scratch

This is a cumulation of some of the work I did during my ML studies during 2020

The goal was to construct commonly used ML methods from scratch, acquiring a deep understand of the algorithms the logic and math behind them, while improving python skills in the process. 
Naturally, these are not meant to replace scikit-learn packages and models in everyday use.
